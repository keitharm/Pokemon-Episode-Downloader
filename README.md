An attempt to fix my old outdated pokemon episode downloader/fetcher
from a year or so ago at http://guysthatcode.com/projects/poke.

This will possibly be rewritten in C/C++ as a command line tool as well
for practice.

cmdline contains a php command line version of the downloader
web is meant to be implemented on a webserver

Hopefully I'll be able to clean up some of the code in the next few commits but until then, enjoy.
